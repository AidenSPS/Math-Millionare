Question Array Layout

so the question array's format is as such{
	question --> 
	gradeArrays --> 
	question(This string is the acutal questionArray with stores the questionString and the answer to the question. This is randomized between integers 0 <= x <= 4). --> 
	questionOrAnswer (if this value is 0, this will display the question, if this value is 1, this value will display the answer to said question);
}
