Question Array Layout

so the question array's format is as such{
	question --> 
	gradeArrays --> 
	question(This string is the acutal questionArray with stores the questionString and the answer to the question. This is randomized between integers 0 <= x <= 4). --> 
	questionOrAnswer (if this value is 0, this will display the question, if this value is 1, this value will display the answer to said question);
}

Coding Problems left:
Buttons removal and newGame button
recalibrating the math behind saveCash();



if(questionCounter == 0 || 1 || 2){ //VERSION 1
			cashmark = 0;
		}
		if(questionCounter == 3 || 4){
			cashmark = 1000;
		}
		if(questionCounter == 5 || 6 || 7){
			cashmark = 4000;
		}
		if(questionCounter == 8 || 9 || 10 || 11){
			cashmark = 64000;
		}
		if(questionCounter == 13){
			cashmark = 10000000
		}
