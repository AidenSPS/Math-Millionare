Things to try in order to fix "var randomQuestion"

diceRoller()

GOAL: To get a random number generator where it can store a value until something is switched true. 

Ideas: flags? (To switch something true if a condition is met)

Pros:
Gets multiple random values, 

Cons:
Whenever the function is called, will always randomize values. So I cannot use that for combining arrays. 

function diceRoller(){
	let diceFlag = false; //Switches true when the question has been answered. Might need to be a global variable
	let diceRoll = Math.floor(Math.random() * 5) + 1;
	if(diceFlag == true){
		diceRoller()
	} 
	else{
		return diceRoll;
	}
}

Question Array Layout

var question = [G1,G2,G3,G4,G5,G6...]

G1 = [["blah blach blah"],["0.6"]]

question[0][1]

question[0] jumps to G1
question[0][1] is pretty much saying G1[1];

question[questionCounter][randomQuestion][1];

for the first question{
	question[0][randomInt, 0-4][1];

	question jumps to gradeOne
	gradeOne[0][1]; //We will say for notes reference that randomQuestion is equal to item 0, 
	gradeOne[0] jumps to the question
	gradeOne[0][1] is the string of the answer 
}

so the question array's format is as such{
	question --> 
	gradeArrays --> 
	question(This string is the acutal questionArray with stores the questionString and the answer to the question. This is randomized between integers 0 <= x <= 4). --> 
	questionOrAnswer (if this value is 0, this will display the question, if this value is 1, this value will display the answer to said question);
}
