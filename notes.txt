Things to try in order to fix "var randomQuestion"

diceRoller()

GOAL: To get a random number generator where it can store a value until something is switched true. 

Ideas: flags? (To switch something true if a condition is met)

Pros:
Gets multiple random values, 

Cons:
Whenever the function is called, will always randomize values. So I cannot use that for combining arrays. 

function diceRoller(){
	let diceFlag = false; //Switches true when the question has been answered. Might need to be a global variable
	let diceRoll = Math.floor(Math.random() * 5) + 1;
	if(diceFlag == true){
		diceRoller()
	} 
	else{
		return diceRoll;
	}
}
